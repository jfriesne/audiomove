Basic Installation
==================

These are generic build instructions.  AudioMove should be
buildable under any OS that has a valid Qt 5.x development environment.

1) Make sure you have a Qt5 build environment set up on your machine.

2) If you downloaded this folder from GitHub (e.g. via a "git clone"
   command), be sure to do a

     git submodule update --init --recursive

   ... so that all the code for all the necessary third-party
   dependencies will be downloaded.

3) Run the included install.sh script:

     source ./build-audiomove.sh

4) In a few minutes, your AudioMove executable should be build and
   ready in the audiomove sub-directory.
