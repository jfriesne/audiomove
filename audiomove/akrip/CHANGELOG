v1.0rc2:
	Added support to change Freedb protocol level.

	Added basic HTTP proxy authorization support

v0.96:
	Added CDDB submit via HTTP support.  Should be used with freedb.org
	only, as cddb.com will reject entries from non-approved programs,
	and they're no longer certifying programs for the classic CDDB.

	Fixed fairly obscure boundary condition when trying to jitter correct
	short buffers (1 frame) filled with all zeros at end of CD.

	Changed AKSHAREDMEM from union to struct, and changed the name of the
	shared memory object to avoid conflicts.

v0.95:
	Added IOCTL_SCSI_GET_ADDRESS calls to the SCSI passthrough code
	to get the host adapter number from the system.

	MSVC project file added

	CDDB non-proxy code can now use HTTP 1.0

	Generation of retbuf.txt in CDDB code now configurable

v0.94:
	Cleaned up the "#ifdef _DEBUG" code considerably.

	Now the SCSI pass through code tries the call to CreateFile with
	and without the GENERIC_WRITE flag -- hopefully this will let the
	call work on more machines.

	The MSVC directory now contains an import lib created with a
	relatively recent version of MSVC.

	Optional paramater can be set via ModifyCDParms to save/read
	info to/from cdplayer.ini when making calls to CDDB functions.
	Set CDDB_OPT_USECDPLAYERINI to TRUE to enable the use of 
	cdplayer.ini.

	Added SPTIOpenCDHandle to scsi pass through code.  Specifically,
	under NT/2000 I don't want to leave device handles open unless
	GetCDHandle() has been explicitly called.

v0.93:	
	Added GENERIC_WRITE to to flags on the call to CreateFile in the
	SCSI pass through code -- Win2K seems to need it, while NT (SP4+)
	does not.

	Added function CDDBGetServerList.  Provides a quick way to retrieve
	the "sites" command from the configured CDDB server.

v0.92:
	Fixed a stupid bug in the Plextor (readd8.c) code.

	Implemented minimal ASPI emulation layer for Windows NT/2K machines
	without an ASPI manager installed.  If the DLL is unable to load
	ASPI, it will check if it is able to use the NT SCSI pass through
	IOCTL by sending an INQUIRY command to devices identified as 
	DRIVE_CDROM by GetDriveType().
	
v0.91:
        Added CDDB support.  The functions are GetCDDBDiskID, CDDBQuery,
	CDDBGetDiskInfo, and CDDBSetOption.
	
	Added dummy "stub" functions for WNASPI functions when WNASPI32.DLL
	can't be loaded.  Eliminates GPF when WNASPI32.DLL is not present.

	Added GetAKRipDllVersion().
