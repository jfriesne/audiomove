Basic Installation
==================

These are generic build instructions.  AudioMove should be
buildable under any OS that has a valid Qt 4.5.x development
environment present.

1) Make sure you have a Qt 4.5.x build environment set up on your machine.

2) Run the included install.sh script:

     source ./build-audiomove.sh

3) In a few minutes, your AudioMove executable should be ready.
